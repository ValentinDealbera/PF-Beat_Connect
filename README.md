# BeatConnect Marketplace

BeatConnect is a marketplace for buying and selling musical instruments that uses a variety of technologies to provide an optimal user experience. On the frontend, Redux Toolkit, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, SASS, Figma and Material-UI were included to develop an attractive and easy-to-use UI. In the backend, technologies such as Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, and Firebase were employed to ensure smooth and efficient operation of the platform. In addition, user authentication and authorization using Auth0 and JWT was implemented, while the secure payment process was carried out through Mercado Pago. The project was hosted on Vercel and Render.com to ensure optimal availability and performance. In short, BeatConnect is a complete and robust platform for connecting artists and independents with music producers easily and efficiently.
